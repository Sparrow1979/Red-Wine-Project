Project name: Best Red Wine Quality Prediction

Description: The goal of the analysis if threefold:

From the business point of view, I will try to answer what are the key characteristics that make the wine stand out and be of 7 and 8 quality category?

I will implement several machine learning models for wine quality guessing. Among many outcomes, I will aim to find out, which model is the best at predicting wine quality.

In this project, I will also apply linear regression modeling for analyzing the features that affect quality of the wine and alcohol level.
